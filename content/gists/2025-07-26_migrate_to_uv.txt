When a requirements.txt file is available
(but no pyproject.toml):

  $ uv venv

... will create the corresponding .venv directory.

When a different python version is specified in `.python-version`
then installed as base, the corresponding python version will
be downloaded automatically.

After this, install the dependencies with:

  $ uv add -r requirements.txt

This will install the dependencies and
update `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

If you only want to install the dependencies in
requirements.txt, then run:

  $ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
