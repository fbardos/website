When a requirements.txt file is available (but no pyproject.toml):

  $ uv venv

... will create the corresponding .venv directory.

When a different python version is specified in `.python-version` then installed as base,
the corresponding python version will be downloaded automatically.

After this, install the dependencies with:

  $ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
