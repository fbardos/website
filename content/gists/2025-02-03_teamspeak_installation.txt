When installing Teamspeak 3 on Ubuntu, move the unzipped archive to:

    $ mv ~/Downloads/teamspeak-client /usr/local

Then add a dmenu [1] entry on a new file 

    $ touch ~/.local/share/applications/teamspeak.desktop

With the following content:

	[Desktop Entry]
	Name=TeamSpeak 3
	Comment=TeamSpeak 3 VoIP Communicator
	Exec=/usr/local/teamspeak-client/TeamSpeak
	Terminal=false
	Type=Application
	Categories=Network;Application;
	Icon=/usr/local/teamspeak-client/logo-128.png
