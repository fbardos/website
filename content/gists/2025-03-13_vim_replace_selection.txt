When replacing a long string in VIM, instead of typing a long regex,
just execute:

  1. NORMAL MODE: Select the string you want to replace and hit `*` 
     to search for all the occurences in the file.
  2. Init sed and leave the first argument empty. When the first
     argument is not provided, VIM will take the perviously made
     selection as the first argument:
     
     :%s//REPLACE_TEXT/

  3. Hit ENTER
