Vim replace selection
---------------------

When replacing a long string in VIM, instead of typing a long regex,
just execute:

  1. NORMAL MODE: Select the string you want to replace and hit `*` 
     to search for all the occurences in the file.
  2. Init sed and leave the first argument empty. When the first
     argument is not provided, VIM will take the perviously made
     selection as the first argument:
     
     :%s//REPLACE_TEXT/

  3. Hit ENTER


Yank to register
----------------

Put the words/lines you want to keep for multiple occasions in a
register (check wich `:registers`).
E.g. if you want to put this and the next 2 lines into register `a`:

  "ay2j

, where:
  - `"a` init register a
  - `y2j` yank this and the next 2 lines

Then, paste the register anywhere with:

  "ap

, where:
  - `"a` select register a
  - `p` paste
