Title: About me
Date: 2023-04-10
Summary: Introducing myself.

Hi, my name is Fabian and I'm a Data Analyst from [Winterthur, Switzerland](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1682243). I'm mainly code in [Python](http://python.org), sometimes in [R](r-project.org). I like cycling, cooking and reading books. Currently, I work for [Ergon Informatik AG](http://ergon.ch).

## Like
* [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software): I'm deeply inspired by people spending their free time on a project and share it with the world. I truly believe this will make our world a better one.
* [Open (Government) Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data): Open Data empowers innovation, is the foundation for discussions based on facts.
* [Linux](http://kernel.org): Started with OpenSuse in 2006, currently on Ubuntu. Linux is exactly one year younger than me (but obviously alot bigger).


## Contributing
* [CKAN-QA](https://github.com/fbardos/ckan_qa): A framework to integrate GreatExpectations into the data pipeline of publishing data on CKAN.
* Generally, I like to collect open data and perform exploratory data anlysis on it later.
